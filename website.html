<a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">Link to youtube</a>
<!--"a" represents anchor element.Nothing but link to another website.
"Link to youtube" is the text of your link.
"href="https://www.youtube.com/" is an HTML Attribute.
Attribute basically modifies how an element behaves.
href is called Attribute name.
"https://www.youtube.com/" is called attribute value.
We can add multiple attributes just by adding a space.
target is another attribute name.
target determines whether our link opens in new tab or in current page.
If we dont write target element,By default it get opens in the same page itself.
If we set target="_blanck", link get opens in new page.
